## 💡 What is **Vibe Hacking** ?

**Vibe Hacking** is a new paradigm in Offensive Security defined by PurpleAILAB.  

Unlike traditional red teaming methods that rely on manual execution, **AI agents autonomously perform red teaming tasks** in Vibe Hacking.

> ### *The Best Defense is a Good Offense.*

## 💡 Why **Decepticon**?

As agents become more sophisticated, attackers evolve accordingly.  
From AI-driven phishing to self-learning malware, offensive techniques are becoming increasingly automated and intelligent.

To effectively defend against AI-powered threats, **we must act faster**—and **we must act first**.  
**Decepticon** is designed for that very purpose: using AI agents to automate red teaming **before attackers automate theirs.**

Built on the robust foundation of **LangChain/LangGraph**, Decepticon grows alongside the thriving AI agent ecosystem. By leveraging the same cutting-edge frameworks that power the future of AI, we ensure compatibility, scalability, and continuous innovation through community collaboration.

Delegate repetitive and manual tasks to agents, and focus on intuition and decision-making to fulfill the true essence of a **CyberSecurity Supervisor**.

> ### *Prepare before AI Hacks First.*


## Quick Start

### 1. Set up the environment with
```bash
uv venv
uv sync
or
uv pip install -e .
```

### 2. Copy environment file 
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Docker (10m ~ 20m)
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 4. Run MCP servers
#### Option 1: Use provided scripts
- On Windows:
```bash
./run_mcp.ps1
```
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
./run_mcp.sh
```

#### Option 2: Run manually
```bash
python src/tools/mcp/(your mcp server).py
```

### 4. Run CLI or Web interface
```bash
python frontend/cli/cli.py
streamlit run frontend/streamlit_app.py
```


## Key features

### Agents

#### 🔴 Red Team Agents
- **Reconnaissance Agent**: Network scanning, service enumeration, vulnerability discovery
- **Initial Access Agent**: Exploitation, credential attacks, system compromise
- **Privilege Escalation Agent**(Planned): Rights elevation and lateral movement
- **Defense Evasion Agent**(Planned): Anti-detection and stealth techniques
- **Persistence Agent**(Planned): Maintaining access and backdoor installation
- **Execution Agent**(Planned): Command execution and payload deployment

#### 🔵 Utility Agents 
- **Planner Agent**: Strategic brain coordinating the entire operation
- **Summary Agent**: Analysis compilation, reporting, and documentation
- **Supervisor Agent**(Planned): Workflow orchestration and decision routing


### Multi-Agent-System Architecture

**Flexible Architecture Options:**
- **Swarm Architecture**: Direct peer-to-peer agent communication and collaboration
- **Supervisor Architecture**(Planned): Centralized control with supervisor-managed workflows
- **Hybrid Architecture**(Planned): Combined approach with both direct communication and centralized oversight
- **your custom Architecture**


### Replay

The Replay feature is implemented to maximize collaboration and knowledge sharing within Decepticon's open-source community.
Please share your usage methods and execution results through PRs!

1. **Execution results are saved** under the `logs/` folder
2. **Replay functionality**: Click the Chat History button to replay JSON-formatted logs stored under the `logs/` folder  
3. **Community sharing**: Use the export feature to share with the community!

## MCP Support

This project supports loading tools via the [LangGraph MCP Adapter](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-mcp-adapters).

You can define your MCP tools in a configuration file called `mcp_config.json`.  
Tools are grouped by **agent names**, and each agent can have multiple MCP servers.

### Supported MCP Transports

- `stdio` - Standard input/output communication
- `streamable_http` - HTTP-based streaming communication

### `mcp_config.json` Structure

```json
{
  "agent_name": {
    "mcp_server_1": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["./path/to/script.py"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    },
    "another_mcp_server_streamable_HTTP": {
      "url": "mcp-url"
    }
  }
}
```

### Example

```json
{
  "reconnaissance": {
    "reconnaissance": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["./src/tools/mcp/Reconnaissance.py"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    },
    "desktop_commander": {
      "url": "https://server.smithery.ai/@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander/mcp?api_key=your-api-key"
    }
  },
  "initial_access": {
    "initial_access": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["./src/tools/mcp/Initial_Access.py"],
      "transport": "stdio"
    }
  }
}
```

**To add a new MCP tool:**
1. Create your MCP tool script under `src/tools/mcp/`
2. Add the corresponding entry in `mcp_config.json`
3. Restart the application to load the new tool
